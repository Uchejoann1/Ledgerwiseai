ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ Nigerian Tax & Business Advisor

This is a Python-based command-line tool that uses AI to analyze financial data from a CSV or Excel file. It calculates a company's Nigerian tax liabilities (CIT, TET, and VAT), audits tax payments, and provides both tax compliance recommendations and scannable business growth advice.

This tool is powered by the Llama 3 70B model via AWS Bedrock.

Features

File Input: Reads financial data directly from .csv or .xlsx files.

Comprehensive Tax Calculation:

Profit Tax: Calculates Corporate Income Tax (CIT) based on company size (Medium/Large) and Tertiary Education Tax (TET).

VAT: Calculates Value Added Tax (VAT) remittable to FIRS.

Compliance Audit: Compares the calculated tax due against a "Profit Tax Paid" field from your file to determine if the company is compliant, underpaid, or has overpaid.

Dual-AI Advice:

Tax Compliance: Provides actionable steps for remaining compliant.

Business Growth: Analyzes financial data (e.g., revenue vs. expenses) to give high-level business advice.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

An AWS Account: You must have access to AWS Bedrock and have enabled access for the meta.llama3-70b-instruct-v1:0 model.

AWS Credentials: Your AWS access keys must be configured in your environment (e.g., via aws configure or environment variables).

Installation

The script will search for the following keywords in your Metric Column (case-insensitive):
